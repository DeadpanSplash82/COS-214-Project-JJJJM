Description of how to run the code: 
First you will need to download the git repository into a local folder on your device. You will then run the command cmake CMakeLists.txt whith a terminal set to the
src folder location. Then run the same command while in the test folder location. If you wish to run the unit tests then run the command make while in the test folder
followed by the command ./test. If you wish to run the actual program then run the command make in the src folder followed by ./main. At this point you will be
prompted for console input to start the simulation.
